/**
 * Launches the [workflow] in a new coroutine in [scope]. The workflow tree is seeded with
 * [initialSnapshot] and the first value emitted by [props].  Subsequent values emitted from
 * [props] will be used to re-render the workflow.
 *
 * This is the primary low-level entry point into the workflow runtime. If you are writing an app,
 * you should probably be using a higher-level entry point that will also let you define UI bindings
 * for your renderings.
 *
 * ## Initialization
 *
 * Before starting the actual workflow runtime, this function will invoke [beforeStart] and pass
 * it the [Flow]s of renderings, snapshots, and outputs, as well as a [CoroutineScope] that the
 * runtime will be hosted in. The workflow runtime will not be started until after this function
 * returns. This is to allow the output flow to start being collected before any outputs can
 * actually be emitted. Collectors that start _after_ [beforeStart] returns may not receive outputs
 * that are emitted very quickly. The value returned by [beforeStart] will be returned from this
 * function after the runtime is launched, handy for instantiating platform-specific runner objects.
 * The [CoroutineScope] passed to [beforeStart] can be used to do more than just cancel the runtime
 * – it can also be used to start coroutines that will run until the workflow is cancelled,
 * typically to collect the rendering and output [Flow]s.
 *
 * ## Scoping
 *
 * The workflow runtime makes use of
 * [structured concurrency](https://medium.com/@elizarov/structured-concurrency-722d765aa952).
 * The runtime is started in a specific [CoroutineScope], which defines the context for the entire
 * workflow tree – most importantly, the [Job] that governs the runtime's lifetime and exception
 * reporting path, and the [CoroutineDispatcher][kotlinx.coroutines.CoroutineDispatcher] that
 * decides on what threads to run workflow code.
 *
 * This function creates a child [Job] in [scope] and uses it as the parent for the workflow
 * runtime, and as the job passed to the [beforeStart] function. This means that if [beforeStart]
 * calls [CoroutineScope.cancel][Job.cancel], it will cancel the workflow runtime, but will not cancel the
 * [scope] passed into this function.
 *
 * @param scope The [CoroutineScope] in which to launch the workflow runtime. Any exceptions thrown
 * in any workflows will be reported to this scope, and cancelling this scope will cancel the
 * workflow runtime. The scope passed to [beforeStart] will be a child of this scope.
 * @param workflow The root workflow to start.
 * @param props Stream of input values for the root workflow. The first value emitted is passed to
 * the root workflow's [StatefulWorkflow.initialState], and subsequent emissions are passed as
 * input updates to the root workflow. If this flow completes before emitting anything, the runtime
 * will fail (report an exception up through [scope]). If this flow completes _after_ emitting at
 * least one value, the runtime will _not_ fail or stop, it will continue running with the
 * last-emitted input.
 * @param initialSnapshot If not null or empty, used to restore the workflow.
 * @param beforeStart Called exactly once with the flows for renderings/snapshots and outputs.
 * It also gets a sub-scope of [scope] with a newly created child [Job] which defines the lifetime
 * of the launched workflow tree. Cancelling that job ends the new workflow session.
 * Note that if [scope] is already cancelled when this function is called, the receiver scope will
 * also be cancelled, and the flows will complete immediately.
 *
 * @return The value returned by [beforeStart].
